 Playground for MVC Pattern
============================

This repository contains list of links to explanations and tutorials (I like or
find noteworthy) related to `model–view–controller (MVC) pattern`_, along with
some example code based on some of the tutorials linked there.

.. _`model–view–controller (MVC) pattern`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller

Theory
======

A good start is `explanation of the idea`_ posted on python-list back in
January 2006, which is referenced on multiple places, eg:

* `ModelViewController on wxpython.org`_
* `What is mvc really?`_

For more details, see:

* `MVC overview from c2.com`_, including `MVC History`_ and `What is a
  Controller Anyway?`_.
* `GUI Architectures`_ by Martin Fowler
* `MVC page maintained by creator of the pattern Trygve Reenskaug`_
